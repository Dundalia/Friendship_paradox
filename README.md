# Friendship_paradox


The friendship paradox is the phenomenon discovered by
Scott L. Feld, according which most people have fewer friends than
their friends have, on average. In spite of its apparently paradoxical nature, it can be proved mathematically that in a social network (modeled
as an undirected graph), the average number of friends of individuals
is lower than the average of the mean number of the persons’ friends’
friends. Anyway, it does not prove that in average your friends have
more friends than you do, as one should prove that the proportion of individuals who have fewer friends than the mean number of friends their
own friends have is higher than fifty percent. I am going to search and
explore networks in which most of the nodes will have more friends than
the mean number of its friends’ friends, to understand if that mathematical result is sufficient to conclude that most of the individuals will have
fewer friends than their friends have.
